# Basic Infomation

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the internet.\
**Default Port:** `21`
```ruby
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
```
If [nmap](https://nmap.org) does not get the service header, it relies on the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) database to determine what service is running on a given port.
