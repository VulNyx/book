### Basic Infomation

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the internet.\
**Default Port:** `21`
```ruby
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
```

When [Nmap](https://nmap.org) cannot obtain the service header directly, it uses the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) database to identify the service that might be running on a specific port.
