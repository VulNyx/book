Hello, **Hackers**! Welcome to the **NYX Blog**!  
This **Cybersecurity** blog has been created by the **[Vulnyx](https://vulnyx.com)** team.  
Here you will find a well-organized and visually appealing collection of **Penetration Testing** and **Red Team Operations** methodologies, which you can use both in real-world environments and in our vulnerable machine challenges in the playground.  
Our goal is to provide you with a well-structured guide, to improve your skills and face new challenges in **Offensive Security**.
